          <h3>JCC Overview</h3>

          <p>
            The Juega Como Campeon bilingual sports academy, is a non profit
            organization focused on expanding life opportunities for
            disadvantaged boys and girls in the Dominican Republic through
            programs in sports, Math, English & character-building. The kids
            come primarily to play sports and have fun, but our programs focus
            on three (3) areas of growth: athletics, education, and character.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Athletic Growth</strong> - Fun, engaging sports programs
              that develop skills
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Academic Support</strong> - Support in both English and
              Math to expand life opportunities
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Character & Community Building</strong> - Shared
              requirements, including keeping our facility and fields clean, and
              community service, to promote a strong work ethic, positive
              self-esteem, discipline, and a sense of community
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            At JCC, we'll use sports to help kids rather than allowing sports
            use them. JCC will be a place where teaching never stops and where
            our team dedicates ourselves to helping disadvantaged kids to reach
            their potential and to view new opportunities, some that do not
            currently exist here.

          <h3 class="text-center">Mission Statement</h3>
          <p>
            The mission of Juega Como Campeon is to cultivate, expand
            opportunities and improve the lives of disadvantaged, economically
            underprivileged children in the Dominican Republic, by providing
            opportunities to participate in youth sports, in conjunction with
            academic support to which they would otherwise not have access. We
            will strive to promote confidence, self-respect, respect for others
            and a sense of community service, developing young boys and girls in
            every sense, while fostering their hopefulness for a better future.

        <article id="director" class="">
          <h3 class="py-2">Director</h3>
          <p>
            Chris Travers has been in the "kid business" since 1991 having got
            his start at
            <a href="https://www.maryvilleacademy.org/"
              >Maryville Academy in Illinois</a
            >
            counseling behaviorally challenged and abused youth. He worked there
            for 6 years until making the jump to classroom teaching in 1998
            (math) and coaching football, basketball, tennis and baseball to JV
            and Varsity teams to the Chicago, Boston, West Palm Beach and Latin
            America (Argentina, Colombia, Mexico and the Dominican Republic)
            youth of middle and high school ages.
          </p>
          <p>
            His projects include several stints at high level basketball camps -
            including running his own - as well as a few months in Argentina
            teaching tennis to aspiring professionals, being an offensive
            coordinator in Varsity football and private classes in golf and
            tennis. Interspersed in his pursuits are some entrepreneurial
            pursuits in textiles and creative video production, to varying
            degrees of success (and failure).
          </p>
          <p>
            His trademarks with kids are running a vibrant classroom, an intense
            and a dynamic practice rife with unexpected forehead smacks (both to
            and fro) as well as creative tournaments that vary and restrict the
            rules to increase long term performance while increasing the
            quantity of fun.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chris, who also enjoys kitesurfing, playing golf, snowboarding and
            watching college football on Fall Saturdays - particularly those in
            gold helmets in Northern Indiana - has been in the Dominican
            Republic for five years and hopes to make his home here with Juega
            Como Campeon.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article id="story" class="">
          <h3 class="py-2">Story</h3>
          <p>
            In the summer of 2008, Chris Travers, an avid kitesurfer, came to
            Cabarete for a two week vacation. During a chance meeting, he was
            offered a teaching job at an international school there. He returned
            to Florida where he was the Head Coach at Cardinal Newman High
            School, but after some consternation, decided to go to the Dominican
            Republic on a one year contract, hoping to take a breather from the
            24/7/365 grind of competitive basketball coaching.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first weekend there while biking around town, he spotted a
            baseball practice on a Saturday morning. On one field, three games
            were taking place: one at home plate, another in left field and a
            third in right field. About half the players were playing barefoot.
            Unable to resist his urge to coach, he volunteered with the local
            head coach to assist him with his infielders.
          </p>
          <p>
            After getting to know the players more intimately, it was hard to
            ignore their educational deficiencies and he realized that his
            non-native written Spanish was much higher functioning than that of
            the teenagers. Many of the kids also expressed to him that they were
            all in: it was major leagues or bust. They had little to no
            understanding of the many in-between places to which their baseball
            skills could help propel them.
          </p>
          <p>
            A place was needed to where kids could be taught English and
            mathematics to supplement their low-standard public education system
            of ½ days and overflowing classrooms. Such a place could provide
            economically disadvantaged youth with high level athletic training,
            while obligating them to study English and Mathematics, A place like
            that could significantly improve their opportunities upon entering
            adulthood.
          </p>
          <p>Hence, the idea of Juega Como Campeon (JCC) was born.</p>
          <p>
            While JCC will not cater to baseball players being that the country
            is filled with scouts, coaches, academies, agents etc… it will be a
            facility that focuses on other primary sports, especially ones that
            do not exist here for lesser means children such as golf, tennis and
            football.

          <p>
            Juega Como Campeon (JCC) provides engaging sports programs, in
            conjunction with academic support in english and math, for
            disadvantaged boys and girls.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Program Details</strong></p>
          <p>
            JCC is based on baiting children into fun learning. Obviously we
            understand that the kids will come primarily to play sports and have
            fun. But before they are allowed to enter practice - which will be
            basketball, they are required to do what we call their 5-10-15:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Deposit <strong>5 pesos</strong> to pay for the ice water at
              practice (10 cents in USA currency).
            </li>
            <li>
              Pick up <strong>10 pieces</strong> of plastic or paper trash at
              the facility.
            </li>
            <li>
              Listen and converse in English with one of our bilingual
              volunteers for
              <strong>15 minutes</strong>.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            When those three things are complete, they are allowed to enter
            practice and join in on the fun which we hope to create in a
            structured yet dynamic way in order to keep them coming back. Kids
            are allowed to enter practice at any time (upon completing 5-10-15),
            yet are not permitted to leave unless they are leaving for the day.
            In sum, they are not allowed to come and go as they please on that
            same day.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article id="academic-support" class="academic-support">
          <h3 class="">Additional Academic Support</h3>

          <p>
            Also, in regards to the English classes, we have a
            <a class="" href="#" target="_blank">Youtube</a> channel for the
            kids to view the lessons of which there are 24 videos consisting of
            10-15 minutes in length for each. The accompanying book is 60 pages
            and costs about $1.75 to print them a copy. They can view the
            classes in their free time. Recommended: 1 video class per week
            viewed twice to deepen understanding, while also completing
            corresponding homework assignments for each lesson.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the near future, we will be building a library of videos,
            particularly in mathematics as supplements to the English program.
            The idea is to augment their education as well as prepare any
            possible scholarship candidates for the SAT exam. We understand that
            this will likely be a select few, but better to prepare all of them
            for this, and in the meantime, all will benefit from Math in
            English.

                  Growing up in Cabarete, Dominican Republic, Omar exemplifies
                  the power of education, opportunity, and perseverance in
                  overcoming challenges and creating a meaningful impact,

                  technology-focused venture builder and investment firm. With a

                  clients like Walmart, Sony, and Colgate-Palmolive on strategy

                  competitive management consulting environment of New York
                  City, Omar seized the opportunity to further refine his
                  entrepreneurial instincts when he transitioned to his current

          <h3 class="py-2">Volunteer</h3>
          <p>
            <em
              >Nothing outsizes the heart of a volunteer. Show up early, stay
              late and fill needs without instruction or request to do so.</em

          <p>
            The volunteer program will rely heavily on the participation of both
            foreign and local volunteers. This, by nature, will be somewhat
            flexible based on what the volunteer can give. We are currently
            seeking college aged volunteers to come down for 1-3 months during
            the summer.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are especially interested in those that are considering teaching,
            coaching or service as a career. A typical day in the life of a
            volunteer will consist of: 2+ hours of intense Spanish classes
            provided by
            <abbr title="Juega Como Campeon" class="initialism">JCC</abbr> free
            of charge, 2 hours of the volunteers tutoring the student athletes,
            2-3 hours of assisting the local head coach in the practices and
            learning drills and skills of the sport they are assisting.
          </p>
          <p>
            While many foundations request that the volunteers pay a monthly
            stipend to help the foundation survive, we will not do so. The
            volunteers are responsible for their travel and living expenses here
            in Santo Domingo. We will certainly assist them with housing options
            (which are extremely affordable) as well as orienting them to life
            here (transportation, phone, local laws and pitfalls, food,
            nightlife, medical, places of interest, etc…). For an idea of the
            total monthly cost of living in the DR for a volunteer, a fair
            estimate would be approximately $1000.

          <h3>Host a Sports Equipment Drive</h3>
          <p>
            Receiving gently used sports equipment will be a critical piece to
            the success of
            <abbr title="Juega Como Campeon" class="initialism">JCC</abbr>. We
            need to emphasize a few points regarding this: 1) please note the
            words “gently used” (or new). Junk is just simply not economically
            viable to ship, especially if it takes up alot of space. 2) shipping
            costs will be paid there which will be delivered to the Dominican
            Republic. Currently, we are using a shipper located in New Jersey.
            Boxes are shipped to New Jersey and then routed to us - via
            “slowboat” that takes six weeks - in the Dominican Republic.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Equipment Drive Process</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Collect all materials before a given date that the drive holder
              can decide on.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pick up the requisite number of 28x18x18 boxes (available at Loews
              or Home Depot).
            </li>
            <li>Pack the boxes - tight, naturally.</li>
            <li>
              Communicate with us at
              <abbr title="Juega Como Campeon " class="initialism">JCC</abbr> so
              we can provide you with the necessary address of current shipper
              OR our address if you ship direct to the Dominican Republic from
              your local post office.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ship them to our carrier in New Jersey and communicate directly
              with them about their payment. Each box of those dimensions will
              cost $50-$65 depending on the time of year. Weight does NOT
              matter. OR Ship directly from your local post office to the
              Dominican Republic.
